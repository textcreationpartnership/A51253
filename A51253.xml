            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> to the end, with Chap. 2. 1. To receive, and drink down his Word into our hearts, with more greedineſs, and to let it dwell there, to be filled with the Spirit, to continue in the things that we had learned through she Apoſtles Doctrin, and been aſſured of by the evidence and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit therein, as <hi>Epheſ. 5. 16, 17. 18.

            </p>
            <p>And concerning the Second, and glorious appearing of that Perſon promiſed, and yet to be expected, and waited for by all Beleevers, with the glory then to be revealed (the ſum of what I ſaid to moſt of thoſe things is occaſionally inſerted in the following Diſcourſe, chiefly in the Anſwer to <hi>1. N's.</hi> Letter) after which I alſo added a word or two, to the way, or manner of Gods giving us the knowledge of theſe things of
<pb facs="tcp:98572:3"/>
himſelf in his Son, that ſo we might be inſtructed in the way of being aſſured of the truth, and goodneſs of them, and of taſting the ſweetneſs and efficacy of them, to the preparing and preſerving us through faith unto the Salvation ready to be revealed in the laſt time; to this I told them:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The way of Gods learning, or giving the knowledge of the truth, and goodneſs of theſe things, is not by working the ſame things over again in our perſons, that were wrought and finiſhed for us in the Perſon of Chriſt, not by making us bear our ſins in our own ſouls and bodies, that with our ſtripes we might be healed, not by giving his Son again to dye in us for our ſins, and in us to riſe from the dead for our Juſtification, to aſcend into the Heavens, and ſit on the right hand of God; for beſides that, thoſe were ſuch works as could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in our perſons, ſo alſo they were finiſhed in his, not to bee itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But the knowledge of the truth, and goodneſs of them given in the teſtimony of Jeſus; and of theſe Works, as wrought and finiſhed in him, and the infinite and abiding vertue of them with the Father for us, that ſo in beleeving in him we might finde the Word or Teſtimony of him through the Spirit, effectually working the Works of God in us.</p>
            <p>Neither Secondly, doth he give the revelation of theſe things, now immediately as to the firſt Apoſtles, nor in ſuch manner as to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old; but now mediately through their Word, and by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and demonſtration of the Spirit therein. So <hi>Timothy,</hi> and all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Miniſters then, and ſince received their Word, their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and furniture in the things of Chriſt. In the concluſion of this Diſcourſe, I deſired, that if any would reaſon about the things they had heard, by way of oppoſition, or otherwiſe, it might be without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and in ſuch order that the people might underſtand what was ſpoken to, what oppoſed, or contended for, and what was ſaid on both ſides. And to this purpoſe I told them, I thought it would be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to digeſt the ſum of what had been into ſome few Queſtions, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed (<hi>viz.</hi>) what the Eſſence of Chriſt is? whether ſomething eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in many Perſons, or one Perſon diſtinct from all other Perſons; and if one Perſon granted, then concerning his Works, whether Chriſt did bear our ſins in his own Perſonal Body only, as the propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> offering? or ſo alſo in the bodies or ſouls of others? And ſo whether in the works done in his own Body, in his abaſement, and exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was, and ſo remaineth in him in our Nature with the Father in the Heavens, by means thereof, the only and abiding vertue for the
<pb facs="tcp:98572:4"/>
taking away of ſin, or is the vertue for that alſo chiefly, or at all ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, in ſome other work or works done in other perſons? and about his ſecond appearing, and the glory then to be revealed, whether that be to be waited for by all Beleevers in this corruptible ſtate of the World, all the time of their Mortality, or made in, or to any in this day? and concerning the manner of Gods teaching theſe things, and our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them of him, whether it be by having the ſame things wrought, or accompliſhed over again in us, that was in Chriſts Perſon, as ſet forth to be the Propitiation, or by receiving the teſtimony of him in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power? and if ſo, how that, whether mediately through the Apoſtles word, or immediately, as they.</p>

               </gap>on after the beginning of this Diſcourſe, To this <hi>James Naylor</hi> anſwered, That there were two things that I had uttered in Diſcourſe which he denied, which when I had made good, or if I could not, acknowledged my ſelf a Lyar, they would proceed to the Queſtions, the two things were:</p>
            <p>1 That God was not manifeſt in the fleſh of the Saints.</p>
            <p>2 That <hi>Timothy</hi> had not the ſame teſtimony that <hi>Paul</hi> had; what anſwer I then gave, may be ſeen in what follows in my Anſwer to their Charges, and to <hi>James's</hi> Letter, but when I ſhewed how he falſified my ſayings, he called me Lyar, &amp;c. ſuch Language was ordinary from them. And ſo pretending want of ſatisfaction, and doing what he could to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inder the people from receiving ſatisfaction, as to theſe things, he kept off from the Queſtions propounded, till one of them (viz. <hi>Rich.

            <p>The truth is, They acknowledge not the grace of God, in the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, as accompliſhed in that his own body, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>From which conſideration, that Grace of God that brings Salvation to all men, inſtructs them not to look into themſelves, or to any light, or ſpirit in them for direction, but unto Jeſus, in that demonſtration of him, and ſtrength to behold him, brought to them in Gods lifting up the Son of Man before them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, now to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and in the light and ſtrength of the Lord in his reproofs, brought them to turn from, and for ſake their own ways and thoughts, (<hi>Iſa. 45. 22.</hi> with <hi>Joh. 3. 14, 15.

            <p>This Doctrin, that ſo rightly diſcovers the weakneſs, emptineſs, and corruption of man (as before) doth therein manifeſt their counſelling every man to turn the eye inward, to look unto the light in them, &amp;c.

But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this occaſion, let me a little minde thee (good Reader) what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have indeed adminiſtred foundation, and opened the gap for ſuch ſpurious and ungodly apprehenſions or imaginations as fore-mentioned.</p>
            <p>1 This Principle, That the Letter of the Scripture, is not Scripture; or thus, That the minde or meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, is not expreſſed in his words, according to the natural import and ſignification of them, no not in things main, and fundamental; and ſo in all other things, that it may be diſcerned in the words, or records left, comparing Spiritual things with Spiritual, and things hard and circumſtantial, with things plain and fundamental, as we are therein directed, but that the mind or meaning of the Holy Ghoſt is to be found out, and determined by ſome other ſpirit. This principle hath adminiſtred foundation, or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the gap for Popery, and alſo for mens deny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing the Grace of God to manward, bringing Salvation to all men in and by Jeſus Chriſt; and it adminiſters as good foundation, or opens the like gap for all other corrupt principles, for take away the Word of the Lord, as declared by the Pen of the Scribe, and what wiſdom is in them? yea they do all agree in this fixt great Tradition, and rudiment of the World. That the letter of the Scripture (as they call it) or the words, as written, and left on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, are not the faithful expreſſions of the minde and meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, only they differ in determining what ſhall give the ſence. The Papiſts ſay, the Pope, or Counſel; The oppoſers of the good of all men, (not much unlike them) ſay, the late Fathers of the Church (and they
<pb facs="tcp:98572:7"/>
muſt bee ſuch as they will account ſo too) or learned men of the times; And theſe that follow after, differ not much; they ſay, it muſt bee ſome ſpirit of, or in them, which they ſuppoſe to bee infallible; As much ground for the one, as for the other, and ſo for taking away one part of the Word of the Lord by one, as there was for taking away another part by another, yea their bottome-Principle is one.</p>
            <p>2 Another Principle that hath laid, or is properly the foundation of ſuch corrupt Imaginations (as before) is that the eternall purpoſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, is the abſolute cauſe of mens ſin, reprobation, and deſtruction; This properly makes ſin, no ſin, or nothing ſinfull, but all mens actions and ends of God, and alſo takes away the equity of his Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them which commit ſuch things, and ſo leads to vain and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Imaginations of no Reſurrection, or Judgement to come. And</p>
            <p>3 That which naturally flowes from both the forementioned, is; That God diſſembles with men, or pretends that which is not really in his heart, when hee offers moſt men grace in the Goſpel, and ſwears he hath no pleaſure in their death, but that they turn and live. This layes the foundation for men, even as they would bee like God, to diſſemble with others; and in purſuance of ſome worldly, or Antichriſtian deſign, to pretend Hamility, Mortification, Zeal, Holineſs, &amp;c, while in their hearts they judge no Act, or practice to bee evill, or ſinfull in it ſelf, (unleſſe to him that judgeth it ſo) but as it may hinder that their deſign ſecretly purſued. Yea,</p>
            <p>4 That which I conceive hath alſo done its part among the reſt, in opening the gap to ſuch unclean ſpirits, is an Imagination that is ſecretly crept into the minds of, and pleaded for by ſome truly gracious, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That men may while they are yet in this mort all body, and accumbred with the law of ſin, the carnal mind, yet warring in the Members, and againſt the law of the Beleevers mind (though in the mind, or ſpirit of the Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in a ſence dethroned, yet) ſo as it is leading them captive ſtill, as <hi>Rom. 7. 21. 23.</hi> And alſo in the midſt of ſo many ſubtill, and powerfull Adverſaries; That yet I ſay, in this time of their temptation and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. They may have already ſo attained, and bee already ſo perfect, as that from ſuch time, or degree of attainment; It is for ever impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them, in liſtening to any ſpirit, to bee corrupted from the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in Chriſt, or ſo to bee drawn away with any errours of the wicked, as to fall from their own ſtedfaſtneſſe, or to fall away, as <hi>Heb. 6. 6. &amp; 4. 11.</hi> which Imagination not only exalteth it ſelf againſt the plain Import of theſe Scriptures, <hi>Phil. 3. 12, 13, 14. 2 Cor. 11. 3. 2 Pet. 3. 17.</hi> with <hi>Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6.</hi> &amp; chap. 4. 11. <hi>Mark. 13. 35, 36, 37.</hi> with many others.

But as wee have ſaid, alſo opens the gap for any manner of ungodly and unclean ſpirit, by moving the entertainers of it (as ſoon as ever they can conclude themſelves to have ſo attained) to forſake, or let ſlip out of their hearts, the fear of the Almighty, by which they ſhould bee kept from departing from him, and preſumptuonſly venture upon the liſtning to, and parleying with any evill ſpirit, or way propounded (at leaſt if under good pretences) yea, this Imagination, that (whether they hear his vayce, and follow him or do hear and follow a ſtranger) they cannot fall or periſh; It hinders them from beleeving or diſcerning that they are back ſlidden, or fallen, when indeed they are ſo; And ſo from receiving timely admonition, while (it being but in part) they might be recovered, <hi>Prov. 14. 16. &amp; 28. 14</hi> yea, this likewiſe further prepares them for ſuch ſpirits, as wee have dealt with in the following diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring but a little addition, to make up their Devilliſh Doctrin of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. yea, 5 And laſtly, All thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or apprehenſions, in which men are directed to have their rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and conſolation originally in ſome gracious frames, or quallifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wrought in them, or ſome works of Righteouſneſſe done by them, and not in the Perſon, or works of Chriſt in his own body for them, which Principles are too much retained by many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in words acknowledge him, (though in theſe their works, they deny him) theſe Principles I ſay, have opened the gap for ſuch ſpirits, which come very ſuitable to their proper luſt, and way, and ſeem not at firſt ſo to maligne the perſon, and works of Chriſt, but rather to hold the acknowledgement of them, though as of things not relative to the ground of their Faith and hope, nor as being the matter of their rejoycing, and fountain of their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which they agree well enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that people thus principled, as aforeſaid, have little, or nothing really to turn from, that they may joyn with what is firſt commended to them by ſuch ſpirits, only ſome opinions that were irrellative to the foundation of their Faith, and rejoycing to bee a little more ſleighted; and the rejoycing that was before placed in ſome works, or Imiginations of their own; now to bee placed in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the like kind; Yea, ſurely all that are ſo principled, will and do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, cloſe with them, on their coming to them, only ſuch of them as are kept off by tradition, that are reſolved to believe as the Church believes, and hold the traditions of their Elders, and Fathers (right, or wrong) And the Devil hath ſo ſure poſſeſſion for the preſent of them, he cares not for troubling them much with any thing to their diſturbance, but if they be ſuch as have been in any meaſure taken off from leaning on traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. and yet retain thoſe Principles, they caſily eloſe with ſuch Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb facs="tcp:98572:8"/>
as fore mentioned, and that without any great turn, or alteration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are ſtill but growing, and going on upon the ſame bottom-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; where as thoſe that have been truly acquainted with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Doctrin of the Grace of God, that brings Salvation to all men, they cannot go out from their Brethren in the acknowledgement of that Grace, to cloſe with ſuch ſpirits as fore-mentioned; but they muſt firſt fundamentally recede from, and renounce the fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that therein they have been inſtructed into, <hi>1 Joh. 2. 19.</hi> (as alſo hath appeared in ſome of them that I could mention) which they are not ſo rightly or eaſily perſwaded to; yet through the retaining ſome luſt, or luſts, always reproved by that Grace, too many even of ſuch as have been going right on their way, have been moved with distaſte at the Doctrin, or Inſtruments by which they are reproved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then to liſten to ſuch as promiſe liberty, or ſeem to cloſe with them, or come in a way ſuitable to ſuch luſts (whether more groſly worldly, or more Spiritually Antichriſtian and ungodly) and yet pretend mortification too.</p>
            <p>And truly, by ſuch evil Documents and Principles, or by ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Luſts (retained) after the lifting up, or magnifying ſomething of Self; this part of the Chriſtian World, in my apprehenſion is) ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for ſuch Atheiſtical, and Antichriſtian Principles, coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der forms of godlineſs, that there is very great likelihood of their ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding under one vizor or another, eſpecially conſidering the Predictions concerning the latter days; therefore in the next place I have taken this pains.</p>
            <p>3 Becauſe I conceive the things diſcourſed of are very profitable, and needful to be underſtood, and diligently beeded by all Chriſtians, eſpecially in theſe days, in which Sathan with ſo much ſubtilty, and as an Angel of Light, and in his Miniſters as Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, endeavours the undermining, and ſubverſion of the great things of Gods Law, in which are contained both the foundation, and end of our faith, and hope. And in ſuch a caſe ſee the Apoſtles example. 2 Cor. 11. and how he admoniſheth <hi>Timothy, 2</hi> Tim. 2. &amp; 3. total. &amp; 4. 1-6. yea minde well how he propounds example, admonition, and inſtruction to us, <hi>Phil. 3.</hi> when ſuch as pretended Circumciſion, and ſo Zent, Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Humility; and as <hi>Col. 2.</hi> yet endeavoured to cut them off from Chriſt, to make faith in him voyd; he then beſeecheth to be followers together of them, and mark them that walk ſo, as wee have them for an example, who may be known, and diſtinguiſhed by the end of their converſation (which is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and for ever the ſame,</hi> Heb. 13. 7, 8, 9. rather than by the particular acts ſimply, as
<pb facs="tcp:98572:9"/>
appears by what follows; therefore more need of a diligent and right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that we may know who we are to joyn and walk with, as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for there are many walk (then they are not Sots, nor Talkers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but walkers alſo; zealous in converſation, as if they would not touch, taſte, or handle any thing unclean) concerning whom the Apoſtle had told them often, and did then tell them weeping (as intimating their hardneſs to receive his teſtimony, and character of ſuch ſpirits, which ſhews they were not ſuch groſly appearing, and indeed if ſo, they had not been ſo dangerous to Beleevers) They are, ſaith he, the enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, their end (namely in their pretended walking, or converſation) is deſtruction (even the marring the Viſage of the Son of Man, <hi>Iſa. 52. 14.</hi> The caſting him down from his excellency, as in his teſtimony, and in the heart of the Beleever; and ſo the Beleever from his faith, and hope in him, <hi>Pſal. 62. 3, 4.</hi> Their deſign to overthrow the Faith, to corrupt from the ſimplicity in Jeſus, <hi>2 Cor. 11. Gal. 1.</hi>) and to that purpoſe ſerving, and magnifying their belly, ſome light ſpirit, or luſt in them, ſome internal or external operations of them (as <hi>Col. 2. 1 Theſ. 2. 9, 10.</hi>) therein glorying in their ſhame, minding earthly things (as <hi>Jude 19.</hi>) though under pretence of ſpirituality; but ſuch as worſhip God in the Spirit, and ſo are directed to walk as they have the Apoſtles for an example, they think to have their rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh, their converſation is in Heaven, in Chriſt, their Treaſury there, from whence they look for him, the Saviour, the Lord, who ſhall change their vile body, in that his appearing, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the working of his mighty power, by which he is able even to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things to himſelf. The Lord mercifully pardoning my unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, afford his bleſſing with ſuch weak endeavours, that they may tend to his glory, and the good of others, is the prayer of the moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all ſo favoured of God.</p>

               <head>The Anſwer to the aforeſaid charges, ſent them the ſame evening, by <hi>Thomas Moor.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>1. THat God is not manifeſt in the Creature, I never ſaid, But that God was not manifeſted in the fleſh, in a full and abſolute ſenſe, in any natural ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> (in the time of this mortality) nor ſo as he was manifeſted in that perſon, the onely begotten Son of God, that is now received up into glory in the nature of man, in that one body.</p>
               <p>2. To the next Charge, that which I ſaid was, That <hi>Timothy</hi> did not receive his word, nor ſo his furniture to his ſervice in the Goſpel, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the perſon of Chriſt, as the firſt Apoſtles, but mediately through their word, and by the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit therein (and for proof of this I brought that, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14, 15. and 2. 1, 2. and 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4. 14.) And ſo all others for bleſſing on whoſe miniſtration, our Savior prayes; beſides, thoſe firſt Apoſtles, that immediately received their word from him, are thus diſtinguiſhed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20. <hi>Them alſo which ſhall beleeve on me through their word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That <hi>Timothy</hi> had not the ſame Teſtimony, as the Apoſtles had, I ſaid not, nor delivered any thing in like expreſſions, nor do I underſtand by his expreſſions what he means, or would faſten upon me; If he mean, that he had not the ſame that they had, I diſown it; if he mean, that he received it not in the ſame manner, it is ſpoken to, and Anſwered before.</p>
               <p>4. That <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtrengthened with his bodily eyes to behold the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt after his aſcention. To this I deſire this be conſidered (which I then propounded, though it could not be heard) <hi>Act. 9. 7. 8. And the men which journyed with him ſtood ſpeechleſs, hearing a voyce, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no man, and Saul aroſe from the earth, and when his eyes were opened he ſaw no man.</hi> Do not the verſes together imply, That immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his falling (at leaſt) in that light ſhining about him, he did ſee the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98572:10"/>
glorified Body in the Heavens (which might occaſion his falling to the Earth) even the man (Chriſt Jeſus) from whom the voyce came, whom they ſaw not at all that were with him (though they heard a voyce?) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if we compare it with that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 8. where after he had ſaid. <hi>He was ſeen of James, then of all the Apoſtles,</hi> he adds, <hi>And laſt of all he was ſeen of me alſo, as of one born out of due time:</hi> I deſire in the fear of God. This may be conſidered, was he born out of due time, to enjoy a ſpiritual appearance, or diſcovery of him? or was he the laſt to whom he ſo appeared? yea, is it not plain, that he appeared to him laſt of all, in the ſame manner as he had done to the other before? I ſtretch not my words, in the ſame manner, further than to a perſonal appearance, or viſible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his perſon. And do they not ſay, That their eyes had ſeen, that their hands had handled of that word of life, in ſuch a ſenſe as Beleevers ſince had not ſeen? compare 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1 2. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 19. (Whence <hi>Paul</hi> to prove himſelf an Apoſtle, ſaith, <hi>Have I not ſeen the Lord?</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 1.)</p>
               <p>5. <hi>That</hi> Naylor <hi>was a falſe witneſs, in ſaying that he had ſeen Chriſt.</hi> To this I Anſwer.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Naylor</hi> would not ſuffer me to ſpeak out what I was about to ſay, as to that, and other things, all will bear me witneſs; yet I ſuppoſe I at firſt ſaid, and I am ſure did after explicate my ſaying thus, That if he had ſaid, he had ſeen Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, in the ſame manner, or (I might ſay alſo) received the word in the ſame manner, immediately from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, which was the thing reaſoned about, then he was a falſe witneſs.</p>
               <p>For they were the Apoſtles laſt in that reſpect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Paul</hi> the laſt of them, to whom he ſo appeared (as before) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 8.</p>
               <p>That he might have ſeen Chriſt after another manner of demonſtration (which in this immediate Revelation, was not wanting but more abundant to them alſo) I will not deny, yea, that he yet in ſome ſenſe, and at this time might (through the Spirits demonſtration of him in his words) for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſee and hate (as thoſe <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 24)</p>
               <p>6. That I never ſaw Chriſt in the ſame manner, that <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles did with their bodily eyes, I own; yet not having ſo ſeen, I deſire to love him, even that perſon, and to wait for his ſecond appearing (as thoſe 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3—7, 8. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>7. That the benefit Drunkards have by Chriſt, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Though the Scriptures be the abſolute and perfect medium, or Rule, according to which Faith is begotten, and regulated; yet Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as declared in them, is made the foundation and bottom of it, as well as the object of it, in whom the Father is beleeved in, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 12 44, 46. with chap. 5. 23, 24. in him it centers, and about him is exerciſed, even him that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth, &amp;c.</hi> the ſame that was reproached by them, as a figure, and one, by whom many men have no benefit.</p>

                     <p>BY the indwelling of God, and in his preſence, I do bear teſtimony againſt thy Antichriſtian Doctrine, preached by thee <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> before many people, which I did then bear witneſs againſt, whilſt I had liberty of the place, and do ſtill before all men, That thou art out of the Doctrine of Chriſt, and his Faith, who denieſt God in his Saints, which is the promiſe of God, and of Chriſt, and that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preached, and witneſſed to, and exhorted to wait for, which thou pleadedſt againſt, and wouldſt bring <hi>Paul</hi> for thy proof, who never prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſuch a Doctrine after he knew God; but ſaid, <hi>Know you not that your bodies are the Temples of the living God? as he hath ſaid, I will dwel in you, and walk in you;</hi> and you are the Temple of God, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God is holy; which Temple you are, and if any defile this Temple, him will God deſtory (<hi>2 Cor. 6. 16.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98572:17"/>
hath ſeen the Father alſo, and he that hath them not, hath not life; ſo death ſpeak: in thee, who denieſt the living God and the Lord that bought thee, and that is the spirit of Antichriſt, who denies Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, as thou didſt, and many more of thy Diſciples, who, when I witneſſed him come again (ſince his Aſcenſion) without ſin to ſalvation, you could not receive it, but took it in writing, as matter of accuſation againſt me, ſhewing what Generation you are of, ſuch as ever ſought accuſation againſt the Son of God, where hee is manifeſt to ſalvation, but who are ignorant of his ſalvation, could never bear the confeſſion of his name.</p>
                     <p>And when I confeſſed the fleſh of Chriſt, your carnal reaſon ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at it, like the blind Jews, ſaying, <hi>How could I have his fleſh in me?</hi> which one of you after confeſſed too, when he ſaw the letter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of it, ſo that further than your carnal reaſon can read in the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that the word which became fleſh, which is aſcended, they knew to be the Bread of life, which they broke, and fed on, who was their Rule and Mediator; But the ground of your Faith is ſeen, and what teſtimony you bear, who ſay, The Scripture is the abſolute rule and medium of Faith, as thou <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> didſt before the people; And when I asked thee, if God could not give Faith without it, then thou waſt forced to deny what thou hadſt ſaid. But ſuch Doctrine as this thou makeſt people beleeve, who are ignorant, and not able to try thy spirit. Oh ſhame with thy preaching! If the Scripture be the abſolute Rule and medium, then Chriſt is not the abſolute Rule, unleſs thou ſay the Scripture is Chriſt; And thus thou not knowing Chriſt to rule thee, thou ſetteſt the letter in his ſtead for the Rule of Faith: But of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, thou are not, nor knows it, who had an abſolute Rule before the Scripture was; But this Doctrine excludes all from faith, who have not the letter: ſo thou that art a Miniſter of the Letter, preacheſt another Rule and Faith, than ever any of Chriſts Miniſters preached, who preached the Word and Faith, in the heart of them to whom they preached, and Chriſt in them, who is the abſolute Rule and ground of Faith; and the Law written in their hearts, and the Spirit of Truth their rule and guide into all truth, and the light in their hearts, which gave them
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98572:18"/>
the knowledge of God, and his glory, which never was known by the letter without; and Chriſt ſaith, the Kingdom of God is within you, which the Phariſees durſt not deny (<hi>Rom. 10. 8. Hebr. 8. 10, 11. Joh. 16. 13. 2 Cor. 4. 6. Luk. 17. 20, 21.</hi>) But thou art more brazened againſt the truth, and wouldeſt exclude God out of his Kingdom, and perſwade all thou canſt not to look for him within, but without, lo here, lo there; But Chriſt ſaith, Go not forth to ſuch Teachers; and thou art found to be one of thoſe he forewarned of, and in that work he foretold of, which is againſt him, and with the ſame spirit thou art ſeen to be an enemy to his Appearance, who is the eternal life of his people, which is not without the knowledge of God in his Temple, for death reigns in the creature, where God is not preſent; and this word of Reconciliation thou withſtands, and all that are led by thee will have cauſe to curſe thee, when it is too late, and time is spent to no purpoſe, and the day of viſitation paſſed over.</p>
                     <p>And from the immediate call, which I witneſs, wherewith I am cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, I do teſtifie againſt thy falſe Doctrine, who denies, That any have been immediately called ſince Chriſt aſcended, onely thoſe who ſaw him bodily upon earth; and when I inſtanced <hi>Paul,</hi> thou ſaidſt, he ſaw Chriſt perſonally with his bodily eyes, when he was called; And when I ſaid, then muſt he be come perſonally again ſince he aſcended; then thou ſaidſt, <hi>Paul</hi> was in Heaven, and ſaw him there with bodily eyes, when the Scripture ſaith, he was fallen to the earth, and ſaw no man (with his bodily eyes) being blind three days; and ſuch confuſed ſtuff thou utteredſt forth, to uphold thy lyes, wherewith thou keepeſt blind people in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but with the light thou art comprehended, thy ground, root, off-ſpring and end, praiſed be our Redeemer for ever; and in thy paper thou telleſt of his <hi>ſeeing Chriſt after the ſame manner the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did,</hi> Then muſt it either be bodily upon earth; or the other went bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into Heaven to be called both which are yet unproved by plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; And thy implying is no ground for me to beleeve that which I know is alye; and here thou art found preaching another Goſpel, which no plain Scripture will warrant, and all that know God in them, ſees thee acourſed, and thy Antichriſtian Doctrine, who denys the Father, and the Son, and fellowſhip with them, who hath ſpoken to his people in all ages, and does at this day, where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this purpoſe, That this Scripture did ſpeak concerning Chriſt, and of theſe things as done, and true in his perſon only; In him, That word made fleſh, in that one perſonal body, prepared for him (the only immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God in the womb of a Virgin) as in that his own body in our nature, he was delivered to death for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification.

In which anſwer is fully granted, that in the life of Jeſus being manifeſted in their mortal fleſh, God is, or may be ſaid therein to be truly manifeſted.

                     <p>I had in my thoughts this twofold Anſwer to have given to your abuſe of that Scripture, if I could have obtained but humane civility from you.</p>
                     <p>1 That already mentioned (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the Text ſaith not, <hi>That the life of Jeſus was manifeſted in their mortal fleſh, now while mortal,</hi> But that they was delivered to death now always, that that might be, and when, and wherein they expected, that ſhould be fully accompliſhed, is clear in that which follows, verſ. 13, 14. -<hi>We alſo beleeve, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeak, knowing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that he which raiſed up the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98572:23"/>
ſhall alſo raiſe us up by Jeſus, and ſhall preſent us with you</hi> (they ſhall not one prevent another in that)</p>
                     <p>And that phraſe, <hi>That the life of Jeſus might be manifeſted in our mortal fleſh,</hi> doth no more ſignifie, that that life of Jeſus ſhall be fully manifeſted in it, in the ſenſe ſpoken of, while yet it is mortal, than that equivalent Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. doth ſignifie. That the body ſhall be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal when raiſed, or that the reſurrection ſhall be made in any, in the time of this mortality, where he ſaith, <hi>He that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal body by that spirit that now dwelt in them.</hi> But that he ſpeaks there of ſuch a quickening or raiſing from the dead, as in which their mortal bodies ſhall be made immortal, is plain, in that he compares it with the raiſing Chriſt from the dead, having alſo affirmed before, that now <hi>the body is dead becauſe of ſin,</hi> while yet <hi>the spirit is made alive for righteouſneſs ſake.</hi> And to that death that is now, or ſtill upon the body, even after we have the firſt fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he oppoſeth that quickening of the mortal body ſpoken of; all which plainly ſhews, that he ſpeaks there of the bleſſed and firſt Reſurrection, which more properly than the other is called a quickening, becauſe it is a reſurrection to life, of which they in their bodies, that ſleep in J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2 This further Anſwer, That if it ſhould be granted you, that the life of Jeſus might be in ſome ſenſe truly ſaid to be manifeſted in the mortal fleſh, now while mortall, yet it makes nothing againſt what was ſaid, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Gods being manifeſt in the fleſh; for this we had then at firſt laid down, That the Spirit of life in Jeſus being received into, and dwelling in the mind, or ſpirit of the beleever, in that word or teſtimony of Chriſt received and abiding there, doth alſo ſhew forth it ſelf, and act in, and through the mortal body, moving and ſtrengthening it to ſuch ſervice, and ſuffering as the renewing of the mind leads to: Yet all this ſaith not, That properly and in a full and abſolute ſenſe, God is manifeſted or glorified in the fleſh of his Saints in the time of this mortality; much leſs, that he is ſo manifeſted either in ſuch manner, or in, or to the accompliſhing of ſuch works, as he was manifeſted in the fleſh in that one perſon, that now in mans nature is received up into Glory, which were the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To your Charge, in its laſt form, with reference to thoſe two Scriptures, <hi>Col. 1. 27. 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 5. Truly, I do not remember that thoſe two Scriptures were at all mentioned in any Diſcourſe, by way of

conference that was between us, at leaſt not ſo mentioned, as you might have any anſwer to what you would have made them ſay; I remember in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Rich. Farnſworth</hi> in continued ſpeech abuſed them; But there was nothing ſaid to him, untill he had finiſhed his large witneſs concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, after which, the time being ſhore, there was but little ſaid by mee, though more than could all bear without ſtorming that we did not rather fall down and worſhip him, and admire his words, as ſome of your company did, as the words of the eternal God, and not of a man (more highly blaſphemous than that, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 22.) but that which was ſaid, was not with reference to his abuſe of thoſe Scriptures, but to his abuſe of thoſe two other Scriptures, <hi>Ro.</hi> 7. 23. and 8. 10. which occaſionally falling upon, we ſhall briefly mention.</p>
                     <p>Hee witneſſed that he was delivered from the Law of ſin in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that it was not remaining or warring there, and from that body of death there mentioned, with alluſion to thoſe expreſſions, as ſignifying that <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſed the like concerning himſelf, whereas <hi>Paul</hi> complains of both, as yet accumbring him, ſpeaking in the preſent time, not in the time paſt, <hi>I find then a law in my members warring—Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> He was not yet delivered, but wretched by reaſon of it remaining, Though yet hee could thank God through Jeſus in whom he had perfect deliverance, which he injoyed by faith, and therein alſo freedome from under the condemnation of that holy Law of God, which diſcovers ſin, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenceth the ſinner to death, and daily victory in the combate, over the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin, and fear, or horror of death, yet ſtill it remained, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in him, and ſo in all beleevers, while here, as to that purpoſe was then told the people.</p>
                     <p>Again, he witneſſed largely of his body being wholly mortified and dead to ſin, as the fruit of Chriſt being in him, and therein, and ſo God manifeſted in his fleſh; And this he ſaid alſo with alluſion to thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>Rom. 8 10. If Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin, &amp;c.</hi> which expreſſions he changed thus, <hi>The body is dead unto ſin:</hi> To that alſo I told the people, that the bodies being dead unto ſin, as it was not therein the expreſſions, ſo neither could it there be meant, becauſe he ſaith, The body is dead becauſe of ſin, now its being crucified, or dead unto ſin, is no part of the fruit of ſin, nor happens it to any becauſe of ſin, but becauſe of, and as the fruit and vertue of Chriſts righteouſneſs, where in any ſenſe, or meaſure, its truly found: But that here ſpoken of, is ſomething of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery ſtill remaining on the beleever, becauſe of, or as the fruit of ſin, though Chriſt be in them, and ſo the ſpirit alive for righteouſneſs ſake, yet the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is dead becauſe of ſin, yea it is yet in it ſelf a wretched vile body, as <hi>Rom.</hi>

And after the ſame conſideration of him, he is (being received by faith, which is the evidence of things not ſeen) in, and to the beleever, the only bottome ground, and foundation of all his faith, and hope in God, both in reſpect of the promiſe of this life, and that to come, yea the thing hoped for, he in, through, and with whom all things are expected, as he is now given virtually and ſpiritually in the teſtimony of him, ſo all things pertaining to life and godlineſs, are given in, and with him in a like manner, and to be enjoyed by faith in him, and in the firſt fruits of the Spirit; And when he ſhall appear again, perſonally in the glory of his Father, and with his holy Angels, then all things fore-mentioned to be given with him in ſuch manner, as to be enjoyed by way of actual poſſeſſion in fulneſs and glory, and in ſuch enjoyment of his perſonal preſence for ever, even the fulneſs of all ſpiritual bleſſings (which now we are bleſſed with in Chriſt our Treaſury) and the total and eternal redemption of the body; of this glory, Chriſt is in, and to our hearts, the hope, not the poſſeſſion, nor do we poſſeſs the glory, for then hope ſhould ceaſe, but if we hope for that wee ſee not (which indeed we do when Chriſt our fore-runner is our hope, as aforeſaid) then do we with patience wait for it. Surely this Scripture is far from telling us, That the glory, glorious reſt, Kingdome, and enjoyment of promiſes, which the Fathers dyed in the faith, and hope of, not having received them, was now revealed in, and upon them, it ſignifies fully the contrary, in ſaying Chriſt was in, and to them the hope of it.</p>

                     <p>But now while they need to try and prove themſelves whether they be in the Faith, which is the evidence of things not ſeen, and the confidence of things hoped for, that is thus to be proved; If Jeſus Chriſt (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>3 Thy third Slander is, That I ſaid <hi>Paul was in Heaven, when he ſaw the perſon of Chriſt there with bodilyeies;</hi> Truly, this alſo is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any colour of ground from any thing I ſaid or writ; That <hi>Paul</hi> had an immediate demonſtration of the perſon o Chriſt, even of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified body in the Heavens, and did hear the word of his mouth, even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpel immediately from that perſon, was that I ſaid (though indeed not on ſuch occaſion as thou mentioneſt in they letter, but) in Anſwer to thy witneſs, <hi>That thou hadſt ſeen Chriſt, as</hi> Paul <hi>had;</hi> And alſo by way of demonſtration, That <hi>Timothy,</hi> and ſo all ſecondary Miniſters in the Goſpel ſince, had not their demonſtration of the perſon of the Lord, nor their furniture in the Goſpel in the ſame manner, that thoſe firſt and great Apoſtles had, who were alſo the Apoſtles laſt in that reſpect, of which <hi>Paul</hi> was one, though born out of due time, and the laſt ſo immediately called and furniſhed. On this occaſion I ſay was that aſſertion forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; And that alſo that appearance or immediate Demonſtration of the perſon of Chriſt, was ſuch as his bodily eyes were ſtrengthened ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time to behold, or ſee, that alſo (at leaſt) I ſuppoſed, and gave

                     <p>I ſuppoſe you will find in my Anſwer to your Charges, that on the mention of that Charge, I neither own nor diſown it as charged on me; but being then in haſte, onely deſired you again to conſider, what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as to that.

And it is clear, that then he appeared to him in the way, verſ. 17.

                     <p>But thou wilt not beleeve any thing (thou ſayeſt) that thou knoweſt to be a lye, however fully implied (though in Scripture, for there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implications mentioned.) I ſuppoſe thou wilt not ſay, whatever thou think, that the Scriptures do by any fair and clear implication ſignifie a lye; But to wave that, How doſt thou know that this is a lie, That <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyed ſuch a viſible demonſtration of the perſon of Chriſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? for thou ſpeakeſt to that, as well as to the other branch, which I

have diſowned; and of them both together, ſignifies, thou knoweſt it is a lye. I ſay how doſt thou know it, or how ſhall we know it, when thou bringeſt nothing at all to prove or demonſtrate it to be ſuch? Is this all the Anſwer we muſt look for when thou affirmeſt any thing, or denieſt any thing. <hi>I know, I witneſs it to be True,</hi> or <hi>I know it to be a Lye?</hi> Indeed theſe were the ſtrongeſt Arguments, and Demonſtrations we had from thee in our meeting, to any thing that I know of, and with theſe, and ſuch like, in the mouths of divers of you together, you could be as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, wiſe, and ſtrong in your own conceit, as ſeven men, that could render a reaſon, and ſtop the mouths of others too with theſe, when you had none of the faithful word to do it withall; <hi>I know it is a lye,</hi> and I pray how doſt thou know? doſt thou think we will all fall down and worſhip <hi>James Naylor,</hi> in receiving what he urges upon us onely in his own name? <hi>I know, I witneſs, &amp;c.</hi> It may be ſuch may do it, as will not receive, or have rejected the teſtimony of the other <hi>J. N. Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> that came in his Fathers name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 43. But give us leave to queſtion how thou knoweſt, and becauſe thou doſt not tell us, I will gueſs in this (thy conſcience knows whether I gueſs right or no;) I fear thou doſt not at all in thy heart beleeve or acknowledge that one perſon of Chriſt, as perſonally abſent from thee, while in this clay Tabernacle (that that which we read of that perſon, and the work done in him, is ſleighted, as figures of ſome other truth to be found in us, is evident enough to me, as I ſhall further make appear anon; but that which I here look upon, as the ground of this thy confident knowledge, is ſomething more, namely) That thou haſt in thy heart wholly rejected the faith, and acknowledgement of that one perſon of the Son of God, in our nature, in one individual perſonal body, even the ſame that was crucified, ſlain, and hung upon a tree, that <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> to be now received up into glory by the Father, in the Heavens, and there remaining in the moſt glorious preſence of God; even in the Heavens, as oppoſed to the Earth, where the former high Prieſts ſerved, and where while he is, he is perſonally abſent from us, while we are in theſe bodies on earth. I ſuppoſe thou mayſt think there might be ſuch a one as <hi>Jeſus of Nazareh,</hi> and that he dyed, as is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him, and happily that he roſe again; but if thy thoughts go ſo far, I doubt they leave him there, even that Jeſus of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> after the fleſh, as one, that in all done before in him was but a type of ſome firſt appearance, to be accompliſhed in us, and now as a type or figure, vaniſhing, and ceaſing from thence ſo to be; So that what we read of his Aſcention into Heaven, and remaining in the Heavens until the Reſtitution of all things, and of his ſecond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſonal Appearance, is to be underſtood
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98572:27"/>
of ſome other internal myſtery to be accompliſhed now in us, not ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed in the words, which muſt therefore be ſlighted as a dead letter. I fear I have almoſt touched upon thy thoughts (though we will not boaſt as thou doſt of compreheading and diſcerning us perfectly, in root, end, and off-ſpring; while yet God knows, and all that know us, know, thou doſt not diſcover us at all, nor ſpeak as one at all acquainted with whence we come, or whither we go; but as he, <hi>Joh</hi> 3.) now if thou be ſo far given over to ſtrong deluſions to beleeve ſuch a lie, that there is not ſuch perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal body in our nature in the Heavens (as before) thou muſt needs from thence be confident <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſee him; for he could not ſee that which is not.</p>

                     <p>I anſwer, It is that in which all the ground and foundation of our faith and hope was finiſhed, or perfected, and without which all done before had been nothing; for even as if Jeſus in the ſame nature and body in which he ſuffered, had not been raiſed from the dead, and therein taken from the priſon, as a diſcharge of our debt in him, we had been yet in our ſins, whatever he had ſuffered, and faith in him had been vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 17. The ſame may be, and is affirmed concerning the neceſſity of his aſcenſion and preſenting, and offering that ſacrifice to the Father, in that moſt glorious preſence of him, from which we ſtood condemned, and being there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and accepted, <hi>And abiding for ever a high Prieſt of good things to come, after the order of Melchizedeck;</hi> for if he were on earth, hee could not be a Prieſt after this order, to abide for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1, 4. <hi>For ſuch a High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſinners, made higher than the heavens, who needeth not daily to offer, as thoſe Prieſts, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 7. 25, 26, 27. If he could have carried his ſacrifice no higher than the former Prieſts, even into heaven it ſelf, and there preſented it in the moſt glorious preſence of God, and if it had not been for the worth, value, and excellency of it accepted there, and ſo hee with it, or he himſelf accepted, and ſet down as the perfect Sacrifice and Sacrificer, he muſt then have offered again, and could never with ſuch offerings have made the commers perfect; therefore the infinit perfection of his Sacrifice and Righteouſneſs in the diſcovery of which all other righteouſneſs is decryed, is by the Spirit demonſtrated in this, That hee is gone to the Father, and wee ſee him no more ſent down to ſuffer, or offer for ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1-10, 11, 12. Yea if he had not aſcended on high, he could not have been ſo glorified in our nature, as was the end of his ſuffering, and as was needful for us, he could not have received in the man, and ſo for men, that eternal redemption, which he had obtained through ſufferings, and ſo that plentious furniture of gifts for men, even for the Rebellious, that the Lord might dwel among them, and that to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he might fill all things with the influences, and vertues of his ſufferings, &amp; give the peculiar gifts to the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12, 14, 15. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 68. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. 10, 11. He could not have been glorified with the Fathers own ſelf fully and perfectly in our nature, and for us, even with the glory he had with the Father before the world was, If he had not aſcended, and gone up into heaven, and remained there in that body glorified by vertue of ſufferings for ſin, preſenting therein the infinite vertue of thoſe ſufferings; for otherwiſe the

glory of God could never have been brought down amongſt, or unto men, nor men received into it, ſo that he could not have been a High Prieſt for ever, and of good things to come if he were on the earth; but now hee is entred into the heavens themſelves, there to appear in the preſence of God for us, there to ſprinckie the Mercy-ſeat, with the continual preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the infinite and abiding vertue of his blood, in that body in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and perſon (by vertue thereof, and to all the ends for which he ſuffered) rayſed, and glorified, in the preſence of God, where we need the perfect Sacrifice and high Prieſt to abide for ever; and he is both in that one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and in ſuch exaltation perfected and finiſhed; In the Name and Anointing of the Father, a Prince, and a Saviour, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 30, 31.

                     <p>It ſeems this was one of the daies of the Son of man, which they did ſee, in which the Kingdom of God was among them. And that this which they did ſee was the firſt of them (namely, the firſt day of Chriſts appearing perſonally on earth, and in the nature of man) appears in that he ſaith (<hi>Luk. 10. 24.

That <hi>many Prophets, Kings, and righteous men had deſired to ſee thoſe things they did ſee,</hi> in this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Son of Man, <hi>and had not ſeen them;</hi> None of the Fathers before ſaw his day, not the firſt of them, as actually revealed and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in their time, and among them, as theſe Diſciples and ſpectators did; Though they did ſee his day by faith, and ſo the things to be done by him in his firſt and ſecond Appearance, yet it was ſo as afar off in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the actual revelation and accompliſhment of them, and as things to come (compare <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 56. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. 11, 12.) Therefore that day of the Son of Man, which now they did ſee, in which the Kingdom of Heaven was brought among them, and therein made nigh them in their hearts by ſpiritual demonſtration (as before) that was the firſt day of the Son of man, not the ſecond (as the abuſe of it to the fore-mentioned purpoſe would perſwade us.)</p>
                     <p>Neither did his own Diſciples yet deſire to ſee another day of the Son of Man, certainly knowing, that this was the Meſſiah, and ignorantly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that he would preſently <hi>at this time,</hi> of his appearing <hi>reſtore the Kingdom to Iſrael, Luk. 24. 21.

To ſignifie which further unto them, our Savior at the latter end of this Chapter, in Anſwer to their Queſtion, <hi>Where this ſhould be, ſaith, Whereſoever the carkaſs is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together;</hi> That ſo they may be quiet, as thoſe that have no need to be too ſolicitous, or inquiſitive to know where, or when, any further than is plainly revealed, becauſe it ſhall be as the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as before) let them now follow him in the regeneration, and they ſhall be all gathered together in, and unto that glorious day of the Son of man when it comes.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, their onely privilege and benefit by that ſecond day of the Son of man, that by his grace appearing through his firſt day are begotten to faith, and hope in him, and ſo moved to wait for him, is ſignified by our Saviours turning his ſpeech in this ſecond part of his Anſwer to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees Queſtion, from the Phariſees, and directing it to his Diſciples; They onely may look and long for that day with deſire and joy. His firſt Perſonal Appearance was not, nor is his miniſterial and ſpiritual comings forth to men, to judge, but to ſave the world, <hi>and that through him the world might be ſaved:</hi> But his ſecond Perſonal Appearance ſhall be to judge, <hi>and render to every man according to his work</hi> (according to the Rule of the Goſpel) that ſhall be onely to the ſalvation of them that through his grace are here begotten to hope in him, and look for him; the reſt ſhall be aſhamed and confounded for ever.

                     <p>Yea, the miniſtry committed to the Apoſtles, is given as the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, in which God hath gathered together all things that before lay ſcattered, in divers witneſſes, types and figures, into one, even in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>For God who at ſundry times,</hi> or in many parts, and divers manners, <hi>spake to the Fathers by the Prophets, hath now in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his Son, whom he hath made heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the worlds, who being the brightneſs of his glory, &amp;c.

               <p>1 There is ſomething intimately charged on us in the Inſcription (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the denying the alone ſufficiency of Gods teaching) and many things propounded by way of Query, which being rightly anſwered according to the Scriptures quoted as the ground of the Queries, will tend much to the diſcovery of the ground of their miſtakes, and to the ſtrengthening the beleever againſt them.</p>
               <p>2 Though the Queries as they are propounded, may be diſcerned to be fooliſh and unlearned, ſuch as are to be avoided by beleevers; yet ſuch is the pretence of zeal for God, and ſpirituality in the acknowledgement and worſhip of him, in the Queriſt, that the folly and unlearnedneſs of the Queries, and the evil ſpirit running along in them, will not preſently be diſcerned by the weak (without ſome diſcovery,) who not diſcerning the ſame, are more apt to be en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>That to deny the abſolute and alone ſufficiency of the teaching of God, without humane helps, or mans teaching, is a ſin of a very high nature, and an evidence of being in a great meaſure given up to deluſion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 8, 9, and 6. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11. and 23. 16, 18, 22 <hi>&amp;c.

                     <p>6 Qu. <hi>Whether any of the Servants of God may expect to receive his Word from his own mouth immediately, as all the meſſengers of God in all Ages did? or whether no other Word is now to be heard in Books, which God ſpake to others?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, All the Meſſengers of God in former Ages did not receive the Word in a like manner immediately from God, not <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy; Paul</hi> neither received it of man, neither was he taught it but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Jeſus Chriſt; God was pleaſed to give in, or into him an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and full revelation of his Son (even of the whole Goſpel of his Son, that he might preach him among the Gentiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 12. 16.) which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the whole Goſpel, he had from the perſon of the Son of God immediately, or in ſuch manner without the help of men as Inſtruments, that he was therein fitted to be one of thoſe great Apoſtles, to give forth the laſt and fulleſt revelation of the Goſpel to all Nations for the obedience of faith, having both ſeen the Lord, and received the Word immediately from himſelf, as they did, though born out of due time thereto, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 1. &amp;</hi> 15. 8, 9, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Not to <hi>Timothy,</hi> for he heard and learned his Doctrin mediately even of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo by the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit through his Doctrin and Miniſtration, and ſo alſo his gifts, and fitneſs for his ſervice, by the laying on of his hands, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. &amp; 2. 1, 2. &amp; 3. 14, 15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 11 - 14 15, 16.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> from whom ſounded the Word of God
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98572:53"/>
to many others, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 8. They themſelves received it mediately through the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Miniſtration, through ſuch demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit, as accompanied the word which they heard of them; See 1 <hi>Theſſ. 1. 5, &amp;c.</hi> and 2. 13 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, none ſince may expect in this day to receive it ſo immediately, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, but mediately through their word, both the meſſage, and fitneſs to declare it. This appears,</p>
                     <p>1 In that they are ſaid to be the Apoſtles laſt, in reſpect of ſuch imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate furniture, and miſſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. and 15. 8. whence alſo, they were to give the Revelation of the myſtery for obedience to the faith among all Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as well then to come, as then in being) And if any man think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Prophet, or ſpiritual, to render himſelf ſuch, he is to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the things, they, the Apoſtles and Prophets have written, are the Commandements of the Lord, and not any other word that may come to him, or from him, <hi>Rom. 16. 25, 26. 1 Cor. 14. 36, 37. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>2 It farther appears in that our Saviour prayes for ſanctifying to, and bleſſing on the miniſtration of no other ſince thoſe immediate meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. But ſuch as ſhall beleeve on him through their word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20.</p>
                     <p>Neither is any other word to be heard, liſtned too, or received by us, is the word of God; But that ſo already ſpoken by immediate inſpiration, and commiſſion, by the one mouth of his holy Apoſtles, and Prophets, and what comes up thereto: All ſpirits are to be tryed by it, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 6. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 3. Before we baſs from this Query, note the inconſiſtency of their profeſſed Principles, and Practices, and the ſecret wickedneſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in it. In the Query they ſignifie, That none ought to hear any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word in Books that God ſpake to others, but only what himſelf hath immediately received from Gods own mouth; and yet they write theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to ſuch as they look upon as people deluded, drawn from their Guide, and ſo farre from having received Gods immediate teaching, or ſubmitting to it, or waiting for it, that they judge them fit to be given up for Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and not only theſe, and divers ſuch Papers, but their printed Books and Papers are very numerous, and are generally diſperſed by them to all people, with earneſt preſſing them to read them: It appears by comparing what they ſay, and do, that their meaning is not to take us from reading Books generally, for they would have us read, more then ever, ſuch as they diſperſe and commend; only they deſire to take us off from reading ſuch Books, as do indeed contain in them matter ſpoken by God to others, as the holy Scriptures, and what in any meaſure truly comes up thereto.</p>

When once the Ear is turned from hearing the truth, or the Heart brought to diſ-reliſh ſound Doctrin, then it is eaſily turned aſide to Fables, and the ſame Evil Spirit will ſecretly (while he crys out againſt hearing men, and reading Books) allow them heaps of Teachers, and Books too, and direct them not only to hear and read, but to worſhip them, in which the truth of thoſe Scriptures (excellent to this purpoſe) are verified, <hi>Col. 2. 18, 19. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 1 - 4.</p>

Whereas on the other hand, the Servants of Chriſt by his Spirit have been always led in all lowlineſs of minde, not to commend, or preach themſelves, but Jeſus Chriſt the Lord; and therein to teſtifie of him, what they did know in the plain demonſtration of the Spirit, even in words which the Holy Ghoſt taught them, that they might propound and lay down ſomewhat for the feeding, and profit of others, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12 - 14, 15. &amp; 4. 5, 6. whoſe word therein was not yea and nay, but in him, (even in the demonſtration of Chriſt, and the things of him) was yea, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 18, 19. 1 Tim. 4. 6, 7, 8. - 11. - 16. 2 Tim. 2. 15, 16 - 23. 24.

For anſwer to this, We muſt take leave to minde our Queriſt of his miſtake of the words of the Scripture to which he alludes, it being a material miſtake. To which doubtleſs, that Spirit that breathed forth thoſe words by the Prophet, would not have led him, but ſome lying ſpirit, that under pretence of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture would pervert it, and ſteal away from us the Word of the Lord, and that we may not diſcern him, makes it a matter of reproach to look into Books, to ſearch the Scripture whether thoſe things be ſo, or no, as he preſents them to our imagination; the word in the text is (in the plural number) Teachers, which he renders, that Teacher; and thine eyes ſhall ſee, for that which he renders thus, it ſhould be in the midſt of them, the words are thus, <hi>Though the Lord give you the bread of Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the water of Affliction, yet ſhall not thy Teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers.</hi> And where thoſe Teachers are, the text tells (<hi>viz.</hi>) preſent with them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, even now in the days of their adverſity, while the perſon of the Lord, the fountain of their teaching, for whom they wait, is perſonally abſent from them (as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6.) and not ſeen by them (as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.)

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here are three or four Queries in one; to the firſt the former Anſwer may ſerve, for that voyce of Chriſt is nothing elſe, but that Word which God ſent firſt to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and then to all the Gentiles, preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt, he is Lord of all, which God hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, who began to preach it perſonally, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by them that heard him, That in that Word, as ſo delivered, Repentance, and remiſſion of Sins might be preached, not in the name of any other work, thing, or perſon, but in his Name, who himſelf bare our Sins in his own Body to the Tree, that it might be preached to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, beginning at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that word of Righteouſneſs which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preached, and left on Record, <hi>Luk. 24. 46, 47, 48. Act. 10. 36, Heb.</hi> 1. 1 - 3. &amp; 2. 1 - 3.</p>
                     <p>To the Second Query under this Head we anſwer; It is known by its own light and power, even by the demonſtration of Spirit, and of power, that is in, and with that Word as ſo preached; which lifts up Chriſt, and the glory of God in him; and therein, and thereby opens the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to underſtand the truth and goodneſs of the Scriptures, declaring him (as is ſhewed before) and know his voyce therein.</p>
                     <p>To the Third, Whether his Sheep may now expect it? &amp;c. we anſwer, It is already preached, and made known to all Nations, for the obedience of Faith, that in the liſtning to, and receiving it (not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the Word of God) according as men by its own light, and power in its coming to them are enabled, men might be made of the Sheep of Chriſt, in that peculiar ſence, and being Sheep might be guided by the ſame; and they that wait for any other Voyce, wait for a Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a ſtrange Voyce, and therein render themſelves none of the Sheep of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>To the laſt Branch, how it may be known and diſtinguiſhed from all other, I anſwer; by its own light and demonſtration, that Word of God, where-ever ſo received as before, it effectually worketh in them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to the diſcovery of all ſtrange Voyces, to be ſtrange, by this Rule, They lift not up Jeſus according to the Apoſtles Doctrin; and to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and ſtrengthening them to turn from all ſuch, becauſe they

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98572:57"/>
truly, &amp;c.—And whether any can worſhip in Spirit, and in Truth, but thoſe that are born of the Spirit - And whether he that is born of the Spirit needeth any other guide? &amp;c. And whether ſuch Worſhips hath not been, and are now differing from all other - And therefore hated.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here are five Queries in one; To the firſt wee anſwer, That Worſhip of God in Spirit and Truth mentioned, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 23, 24. is, that worſhip of him, that is, in the light and power of, and according to the Spirits teſtimony concerning Jeſus, as now come forth in the Goſpel, and ſo in Chriſt Jeſus who is the Truth. And this called worſhipping in ſpirit, and in truth, as oppoſed both to the <hi>Samaritans</hi> worſhip, which was never right, but in, and according to the wiſdom of the fleſh, and ſo in a falſe way; and alſo as oppoſed to the Jewiſh worſhip, which ſometimes was right, while yet it was in and through (that killing letter of the Law to which the Miniſtration of the Spirit, the Goſpel as now come forth is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.) and alſo in and through the Types and Shadows of the Law (to which Jeſus Chriſt, the Body, and truth of them is oppoſed, <hi>Col. 2. 17. Joh.</hi> 1. 17.) This ſence of the Spirit, and Truth, in which God is to be worſhipped, is confirmed in other Scriptures, for the Spirit. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. The Angel admoniſhing <hi>John,</hi> not to worſhip him, but God, inſtructs him thus; The teſtimony of Jeſus (and not any Meſſenger that brings it) is the ſpirit of Prophecy (in which God is now to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped) for the truth. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. we are the Circumciſion, which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus the Truth, and have no confidence in the fleſh, &amp;c. And ſo our Saviour interprets the true Worſhip, <hi>Joh. 5. 22, 23, 24. The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son,</hi> that all men ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the Father, he that honoureth not the Son, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Father that ſent him. And to let us know who it is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed honours the Son, and ſo the Father that ſent him; it follows, <hi>hee that heareth my Word</hi> (which alſo is the word or teſtimony of him that ſent him concerning him, <hi>Joh. 7. 16. &amp; 14. 23, 24. 1 Joh. 5. 9-12, 13.) And ſo beleeveth on him that ſent me,</hi> &amp;c. like to this is that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 44. 49. and that two-fold Rule for the trial of Spirits before ſpoken to, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1-6. They then that magnifie, or glorifie the Word of the Lord, as declared in the Apoſtles Doctrin (as <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48.) and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it beleeve, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo in the Father are the true worſhippers.</p>
                     <p>To the Second part of the Query we anſwer, That as it is true, that no man ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, renders Jeſus (in his Perſon, or works done in his own Body for ſinners) execrable, or undeſirable; ſo likewiſe is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98572:57"/>
it true, that no man can truly ſay, confeſs, or acknowledge Jeſus as the Chriſt, in his Doctrin, or Worſhip, but by the Spirit of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. and whoſoever beleeveth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, he is therein, and thereto bornof God, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 1. Joh.</hi> 1. 12. 13. the other parts of the Query, as much as is needful, are anſwered before.</p>
                     <p>14 Qu. <hi>What, and where that light is,</hi> Joh. 1. 9. <hi>that being come into the World is the condemnation of all that are in darkneſs? &amp;c.—And whether it be not the condemnation of all the World that beleeve not in it—And whether there be any other condemnation? &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>1 Not <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> but Jeſus that was of <hi>Nazareth</hi> (the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi>) that was conceived of the Holy Ghoſt in the wombe of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> born in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Iudea,</hi> in the days of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar,</hi> &amp;c. even that word that was then, and ſo made Fleſh, and came and dwelt amongſt men (and not any other thing, or perſon) who through ſufferings is now entred into glory; That I ſay, and no other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or thing, is <hi>The true light that lightneth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> Joh. 1. 8, 9. 14. 15-18. 41. 45. &amp; 8. 12. &amp; 12. 44, 45, 46. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12.</p>
                     <p>2 The Text ſaith not This light is the condemnation of all (or any) that are in darkneſs, but this is the condemnation, <hi>That light is come into the World, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil;</hi> Their loving darkneſs rather than light, when the light comes unto them (and not the coming of the light to them) is the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſin, and that which makes other ſins condemnable, as alſo, <hi>Ioh. 15. 22. 24. Zach.</hi> 5. 1-4.</p>
                     <p>3 This light perſonally is received by the Father in the Heavens, <hi>Act,</hi> 3. 20. but in his influences virtually, and Spiritually among men, and dwelling in them, in whom he dwelleth by faith, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 17. 2 Cor. 4. 6. Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17-19.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98572:58"/>
the Text it ſelf demes them (<hi>viz.</hi>) That by the Law of Sin, and Death, ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. is meant the ſame with the law of ſin in his members, (mentioned Chap. 7. 21, 23.) which did warre againſt the law of his mind, and led him captive in ſome ſence to it ſelf; and</p>
                     <p>2 That he was made free from that Law of Sin in his Members, that it was not ſo much as warring againſt the law of his minde now; both theſe I ſhall wholly deny; and as they hang together, ſo they will fall together in anſwer to one; That by the Law of Sin, and Death, Chap. 8. 2. is not meant the ſame with the law of ſin in his members, Chap. 7. 21, 23. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, That from the Law of Sin, and Death, mentioned Cha. 8. 2. he ſaith, he was made free; but of the other, Chap. 7. 21, 23, &amp;c. he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms not that he had before, but that he did now finde a law in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, warring againſt the law of his minde; indeed, before the Goſpel of the Grace of God came, or was received, there was no diſcovery, or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of that-Law in his members, and therefore no occaſion for ſuch a warre; but ſince was the Combate, and though it had been unthroned in his minde, yet it was ſtill warring in his members, and he was not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it, though he could rejoyce in God, in whom he had perfect deliverance, and enjoyed it by faith and hope of perfect deliverance in himſelf by Chriſt, when he ſhould be delivered from the whole body of this Death; yea by that Law of Sin and Death mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. (as appears by the next verſes) is meant, that holy and righteous Law of God, mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12-16. for ſo in the next verſes of that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. with reference to the ſame Law, mentioned verſ. 2. he ſignifies, the reaſon of its inability to give us life and peace, was not any weakneſs, or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in itſelf, but the weakneſs of our fleſh, and alſo propounds that as one great end of what Chriſt hath done, that the righteouſneſs of that Law might be fulfilled in them that beleeve, &amp;c. And that Law is therefore called a Law of Sin, and Death, becauſe it diſcovers Sin, and ſentences and concludes the Sinner under death, yet itſelf is holy, juſt, and good, Chap. 7. 10. whereas the other Law, Chap. 7. 20, 23. is ſinful, ſin it ſelf, a body of ſin; this being underſtood, the foundation of the Query falls; yet this further Anſwer we ſhall give. By that Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, by which he was made free from the condemnation, and charges of this law of Sin, and Death, is meant nothing elſe but the Goſpel of Chriſt (which is that Old and New Commandement of the everlaſting God, the Law of Liberty, <hi>Joh. 12. 47-50. 1 Ioh. 2. 7, 8. Iam.</hi> 1. 25.) the Doctrin of the Spirit of Life that is in Chriſt Jeſus, or (of that Spirit) concerning the life, Juſtification, Peace, and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt Jeſus. This appears plainly,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:98572:58"/>1 By conſidering the next Verſe, in which he demonſtrates how, and with what Argument the law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt freed him, in which he propounds the main and fundamental Propoſition, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goſpel in ſuch caſes, and in all other; for what the Law could not do (in that it was weak through the fleſh) God ſending forth his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, &amp;c. as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                     <p>2 It appears by comparing this with <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16, 17. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. &amp;c. where the Goſpel of Chriſt, even that preaching of the Croſs, as by them delivered, is ſaid to be the power of God to Salvation to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>3 It further appears, by comparing this with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. where that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel, or Miniſtration given to the Apoſtles, and by them to us, is called the Miniſtration of Spirit, of Life, of Glory, &amp;c. as oppoſed to the Miniſtration of the Law as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which (as ſo oppoſed) is called a killing Letter, a Miniſtration of Death, of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And this Goſpel is ſtill of the ſame quality, it effectually worketh in them that beleeve, in diſcovering and opening what Chriſt hath done for them; in delivering them from the Curſe of the Law in himſelf, as in the publick perſon; that in coming in to him, by faith in him, they might enjoy the benefit, pacifying their Conſcience, and healing their Nature; and ſo in the diſcovery of the Vertues, and acceptance of what Chriſt hath done with the Father, and is become according to the ends of his Croſs. This having the Arm of God in it, as well as ſolid Arguments to that purpoſe, it purgeth the Conſcience from guilt of ſin by the Law, and from dead works, to ſerve the living God, and ſo quickens to new and livening hope, and affections, through the Reſurrection of Jeſus, ſo as they have their Remiſſion, Peace (as alſo Sanctification, Preſervation, &amp;c.) through his Name, <hi>Acts</hi> 10, 43. &amp; 13. 39. 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18.

                     <p>To his Concluſion at the cloſe of the Queries, in which hee boaſts of Gods revealing by his Spirit in him, the great deluſion others are in, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtructed to look to a Chriſt Crucified without them, while they are in their filthineſs, and firſt nature, &amp;c. as more at large may be ſeen in the Copy of his writing fore inſerted; To this I ſay we anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Surely the Lord doth not reveal any thing by his Spirit in, or to any, but ſo as therein he enableth them that receive his Revelation, in ſome meaſure to make it known; he to this purpoſe appeareth, that he may make them witneſſes of thoſe things in which he appeareth.

                     <p>For anſwer to it, let us ſee what Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles have preached (as to this) <hi>The Son of Man came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt, for God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son</hi> (the Saviour of the World, and) <hi>to be ſo lifted up, as</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs,</hi> as an Object prepared for the healing of all that have ſinned, and muſt dye, that whoſoever beleeveth in him, as ſo lifted up before them, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life; <hi>For God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved;</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt by the Grace of God taſted Death (not in, but) for every man, and gave himſelf a Ranſom to God for all men, he gave his Fleſh for the life of the World, and is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and Man, the ſtanding Propitiation, not for our ſins only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole World, and a teſtimony unto men in due time, having himſelf in his own Body (not in our Bodies) born our ſins to the Tree; he dyed, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the Fleſh, but quickned by the Spirit, &amp;c.

                        <p>The Reader may ſee a little in <hi>J.
